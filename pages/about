Hi I am Rahul K , I think myself to be an interesting individual but if you dont, you
could get a better taste XD. I hate playing chess and practicing piano, but what i love
is to workout and listen to music. I wish to start of my career as an SRE intern and 
follow it up with golang intern or vise versa and then after a few years of job, I wish
to get into business. I have no clue what i shall be selling but we can figure that out
in another 13 years. I am very enthusiastic when it comes learning anything regarding
philosophy or psychology.I like playing soccer and I love talking to people. So far
Ive read books such as Beyond good and evil by Nietzsche and 48 laws of power by Robert
Greene and they are pretty cool. Im single af but I do not wish to waste my precious 
time searching for "the one" when i haven't found myself in the first place. Progress
means everything to me. I am brutally honest most of the time and I do not sugarcoat my
words. My work is fueled by anger. I might be sounding scary right now but I consider
myself one of the most open and good willed person you could ever meet. This world is
an illusion. Thank you for listening to me so far.
