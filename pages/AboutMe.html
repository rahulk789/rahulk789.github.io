        <p>Hi, I am <i>Rahul K</i> . I think myself to be an <i>interesting</i> individual with
        a peculiar taste in almost anything. I hate playing chess and practicing piano, but what i love
        is to workout and listen to music. I wish to start of my career as an SRE intern and 
        follow it up with golang intern or vise versa and after a few years of job, I wish
        to get into business. I have no clue what i shall be selling but we can figure that out
        in another 13 years. I am very <i>enthusiastic</i> when it comes learning anything regarding
        philosophy or psychology.I like playing soccer and I love talking to people. So far
        Ive read books such as Beyond good and evil by Nietzsche and 48 laws of power by Robert
        Greene and they are pretty cool. </p>

        <p>I do not wish to waste my precious 
        time searching for "the one" when i haven't found myself in the first place. Progress
        means everything to me. I am brutally <i>honest</i> most of the time and I do not sugarcoat my
        words. My work is fueled by <i>anger</i>. I might be sounding scary right now but I consider
        myself one of the most open and good willed person you could ever meet. This world is
        an illusion. Thank you for listening to me so far.</p>
