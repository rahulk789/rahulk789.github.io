# Why you shouldn't play chess?
Hey readers, As you might have heard from literally anyone you've met, "Chess is
a game for the intelligent" or "Chess is so fun and interesting!!" or "There are more number
of possible chess positions than there are atoms in this universe!!" and what not. Before
I spill the beans, I'd like to state here that chess indeed is a great game and allows
one to be creative and think of crazy lines. It improves one's pattern 
recognition skills and sequential memory. But these are the fun and happy parts of the
game.
It is difficult for a non chess player to realise the dark sides of the game without
overdosing on it; so I shall help you understand this realm. 
\
Chess is frustrating when you lose and trust me, its so easy to lose.
 No matter how good you get, you will never feel good enough. 
 Sometimes the game just feels unfair when you lose on time. after getting a winning 
 position after grinding, one goddamn mistake is gonna cost you the game.
 Chess is more about not making mistakes and less about making good moves and
 how demoralising is that!!! No matter how good and creative moves i make, 40 in a row
 50? 100? it doesnt matter, if I make a single mistake the game is done.
 So these repeated losses drive the chess players nuts, and most of them (like hikaru XD)
 end up being extremely toxic.
\
 1 minute games really get messy when one has 0.5 seconds 
 on clock and the game becomes more of a "who can click faster" instead of chess.
 To be a good chess player, one must learn not to give up even after making a 
 terrible move, because your opponent can make a mistake too. One must have
 the courage to not give up and resign and play the game no matter what.
 Due to these reasons, chess has increased my pain tolerance and the ability to keep
 my emotions stable during tough times. This is one of the most helpful things that 
 chess has taught me.
 \
 Anything that needs perfectionism, mastering the same would drive the learner into
 depression. Infact, most of the successful chess players end up being chainsmokers and
 alcoholics (such as tal himself).So if you look closely, you will see a pattern
 chess=insanity. Online chess is the most insane forms of chess due to the reasons 
 listed above. So after all this, chess in moderation would be the right solution but
 unfortunately thats like saying, alcohol in moderation is fine. Chess is additive.
 \
 With all that said, if I tell you to play chess, consider that I hate you to the core
 XD. Here's a study I made of [BongCloud](https://lichess.org/study/rCp5pnHt)
 Although not everyone would share the same opinion as me, but at least Paul Morphy
 does. With that I shall end this blog with his lovely quote. Thanks for reading.
