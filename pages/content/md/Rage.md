## Is Anger necessarily bad?
Hey readers! In this blog i shall be giving my own perspectives on anger and other similar emotions.
Anger causes one's blood to rush from their brain to the body muscles. It is an emotion
(like any other) which is triggered by the amygdala which is responsible for identifying
threats to our wellbeing. Although one can control these emotions with the help of our
eternally logical part of the brain: prefrontol cortex. Now that we have that out, lets
discuss the philosophy of it. Anger seems to be having a very bad reputation among the
commoners. They seem to despise it and choose to repress it which is not the way to 
approach this god's gift. Controlled anger can bring amazing outcomes! Anger can be used
as a tool to manipulate your aquintances into doing work for you. It can be used to
make bargains in a tight business setting. Anger triggers the release of a neurotransmitters 
known as catecholamines which lead to a burst of energy. One can use this energy to 
channel oneself to do something productive such as writing or setting up goals. Anger
leads to introspection which inturn can lead to self-improvement. This emotion is 
often experienced by the optimistic and hopeful individuals who wish to achieve great
things in life. Feeling negative emotions isn't always a bad thing. Mental breakdowns
occur when something big is changing for the good and one must embrace it instead
of being against the emotion in itself. Do not be repulsed by anger and frustration.
Fall into the abyss and make the abyss the gaurd of your holy heavens.
Thank you for reading patiently.
